      - Pragmatic design, many clinicians
      - Robust delirium detection (CAM + chart)

knowledge_check:
  - q: "In the Evered et al. study, what were the BIS targets for the two groups?"
    a: "BIS 35 (deep) vs BIS 50 (light). The study randomized patients to either a &ldquo;light&rdquo; target of BIS 50 or a &ldquo;deep&rdquo; target of BIS 35, achieving a true dose-separation design."
  - q: "What was the primary outcome finding in the Evered et al. study?"
    a: "Lower delirium in the BIS 50 group: 19% vs 28% (OR 0.58, p=0.010)."
  - q: "Which potential confounding factor was identified in Evered et al.?"
    a: "Higher MAP (~4 mmHg) and lower vasopressor use (~20%) in the BIS 50 group, which could independently influence delirium risk."
  - q: "What longer-term cognitive outcome was noted in the Evered et al. study?"
    a: "Fewer patients with AMTS &le;6 at 1 year in the BIS 50 group (9% vs 20%), suggesting potential longer-term cognitive benefit."
  - q: "What was the intervention in the ENGAGES trial?"
    a: "EEG-guided anesthesia with clinicians encouraged to minimize EEG suppression and avoid BIS &lt;40, compared to usual care where EEG was hidden."
  - q: "What was the primary outcome result in ENGAGES?"
    a: "No significant difference: 26.0% delirium in EEG-guided vs 23.0% in usual care (p=0.22), despite achieving physiologic separation."
  - q: "What clinical tradeoff was observed in the EEG-guided group of ENGAGES?"
    a: "More undesirable intraoperative movement: 22.3% vs 15.4%, reflecting the challenge of attempting lighter anesthesia."
  - q: "What was the magnitude of volatile concentration difference achieved in ENGAGES?"
    a: "0.69 vs 0.80 MAC (&Delta;0.11 MAC) &mdash; a modest but real difference."
  - q: "Why did Evered show benefit but ENGAGES did not?"
    a: "Evered tested a larger dose separation (BIS 35 vs 50) and asked a fundamentally different question (targeted depth vs EEG feedback). Different questions with different achieved separations."
  - q: "Based on both studies, what is the most evidence-based practice recommendation?"
    a: "Avoiding prolonged burst suppression may be reasonable in high-risk patients, though depth alone may not prevent delirium. Delirium is multifactorial."
